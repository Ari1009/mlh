## :space_invader: About

This is a Python script for summarizing and generating a README file for a given code file. It uses the OpenAI API for code summarization and text completion. The main function reads the code file path as a command-line argument, calls multiple helper functions, and generates a README file with the code summary, usage instructions, list of expected environment variables and usage of OpenAI API if used in the code.
